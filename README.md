# Vegas Slot Machine - Casino Jackpot Assignment

A full-stack slot machine game built with React (Tailwind CSS) frontend and NestJS backend.

## Project Structure

- `frontend/` - React application
- `service/` - NestJS backend API

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)
- npm or yarn
- Docker and Docker Compose (for containerized setup)

### Option 1: Docker Compose

The easiest way to run the application is using Docker Compose, which will start both frontend and backend services with a single command:

```bash
# Start both applications
docker compose up

# Stop the applications
docker compose down
```

The applications will be available at:

- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend: http://localhost:4000
- API Documentation: http://localhost:4000/api/docs

### Option 2: Manual Setup

#### Backend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd service

# Install dependencies
npm installâˆ‚

# Copy environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Start development server
npm run start:dev
```

The backend will be available at `http://localhost:4000`

#### Frontend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment file (if exists)
cp .env.example .env

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

### Running Both Applications

You can run both applications simultaneously by opening two terminal windows:

**Terminal 1 (Backend):**

```bash
cd service
npm run start:dev
```

**Terminal 2 (Frontend):**

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

## Game Rules

- Players start with 10 credits
- Each spin costs 1 credit
- Win by getting 3 matching symbols
- Rewards: Cherry (10), Lemon (20), Orange (30), Watermelon (40)
- House cheating activates at 40+ credits (30% re-roll chance)
- Increased cheating at 60+ credits (60% re-roll chance)

## Development Journey (~9h)

### Step 1: Read the task and choose tech stack (20min)

- First, I carefully read through the task document to understand all the requirements:
  - Full-stack slot machine game with frontend and backend
  - Server-side cheating mechanism based on player credits
  - Client-side spinning animations with staggered reveal
  - Session management and credit system
  - Cash-out functionality
- After understanding the requirements, I started thinking about technology choices:
  - **Frontend**: I chose React without doubts since I have the most experience with it and it's considered a standard for web applications. React's component-based architecture and state management capabilities make it perfect for this type of interactive game.
  - **Backend**: For the backend, this task is relatively simple so technically we could use many different technologies. I chose TypeScript + NestJS for several reasons:
    - Easy to set up and get started quickly
    - TypeScript ensures type safety and makes code review easier since frontend and backend is on TypeScript
    - NestJS because I have the most experience with this framework
    - NestJS works exceptionally well for REST APIs with its built-in decorators and dependency injection
- **Database consideration**: For sure in a real application I would use some database, but since this is a test app, to avoid unnecessary complexity I decided to create a separate module that stores everything in memory. This can easily be replaced with a database in production without changing the core business logic.
- **Development workflow**: I decided to follow regular development practices by having one `main` branch and creating separate feature branches with pull requests, as this is how it's typically done in real development environments. This approach might help clearly review the process of development of this solution, as each feature will be developed in its own branch with clear commit history and pull request descriptions.

### Step 2: Project Setup (10min)

- Created monorepo structure with `frontend` and `service` directories.
- **Frontend Setup**: Used Vite to create a default React skeleton application with a single page. The app includes the standard Vite React template with basic styling and a simple welcome page.
- **Backend Setup**: Used NestJS CLI to create an empty NestJS application with minimal configuration. The service includes just one health endpoint (`/health`) for basic connectivity testing.
- **Architecture Decision**: Decided to make frontend and service fully independent applications that can be developed, deployed, and run separately. This allows for better separation of concerns and flexibility in deployment strategies.
- Both applications are configured to run on their default ports (frontend: 3000, backend: 4000) and are ready for development.

### Step 3: Backend Development (~3h)

- **Development Order Decision**: I decided to develop the backend API first before working on the frontend. This approach allow me to establish a well-defined endpoints and business logic, making it easier to build the frontend with confidence that the API contracts are stable and functional.

- **Authorization Implementation (30min)**: Even though standard authentication wasn't required in the task, I implemented a comprehensive authorization system that follows common auth patterns. Each game session is treated as a separate user with a JWT token for session management. This approach provides better security, scalability, and clean separation between different player sessions.

- **Swagger API Documentation Setup (10min)**: Implemented comprehensive Swagger documentation for all API endpoints with proper decorators, response types, and authentication requirements. The interactive API documentation is available at `/api/docs` and includes detailed descriptions, request/response examples, and the ability to test endpoints directly from the browser interface.

- **Configuration Management Setup (10min)**: Implemented centralized configuration using `@nestjs/config` to replace scattered `process.env` usage throughout the codebase. This provides better type safety, centralized configuration, and easier environment switching.

- **Main Game Session Logic Implementation (2h)**: Designed and implemented the core game mechanics with a balance management system:
  - **Balance Architecture**: I decided to implement a two-tier balance system where users have an overall balance that allocates 10 credits to each new session. This approach provides better control over credit distribution and prevents players from creating multiple sessions to exploit the system.
  - **Session Lifecycle Management**: I created a complete session management system where users can start a new game session, perform rolls during the session, and cash out when finished. Each roll result is stored in the database to have the game history.
  - **Credit Flow System**: I implemented a credit flow mechanism where credits are deducted from the session balance for each roll, and upon cash out, the remaining session balance is transferred back to the user's overall balance. This ensures credit tracking and prevents credit loss.
  - **Game Configuration Centralization**: I decided to move all game-related configuration (symbol rewards, cheating thresholds, cheating probabilities) to the application configuration module. This makes it easy to adjust game parameters like cheating behavior or winning credit amounts without services code changes, simply by modifying configuration file.
  - **Database Integration**: I set up database entities and repositories for game sessions and game rolls to maintain game state and provide game history tracking.

### Step 4: Frontend Development (~4h)

- **TypeScript Configuration Update (5min)**: I realized that during the initial setup, I created the frontend without TypeScript configuration. To maintain consistency with the backend and ensure type safety across the entire application, I updated the frontend configuration to use TypeScript.

- **Frontend Architecture Setup (1h)**: Defined the frontend architecture to support the slot machine game requirements:

  - **Styling Framework**: Installed and configured Tailwind CSS for easy styling. Tailwind provides utility classes that make it simple to create responsive and modern interfaces without writing custom CSS.
  - **Basic UI Components**: Created reusable UI components to maintain consistency across the application:
    - `Button` component for interactive elements like spin and cashout actions
    - `Table` component for displaying game history and results
    - `BalanceLabel` component for showing current credit balance with proper formatting
  - **API Integration Setup**: Established API client setup with authentication handling.
  - **State Management Decision**: Created a `contexts` folder and implemented React Context for state management. I decided to use Context API instead of introducing more complex state management libraries (like Redux) to keep the application simple and avoid unnecessary complexity for such a straightforward UI structure.
  - **Authentication Flow**: Implemented automatic sign up logic on app initialization to create a seamless user experience without requiring manual registration.
  - **Game Assets**: Added slot machine symbols (cherry, lemon, orange, watermelon) as PNG assets to provide visual representation for the game symbols.

- **User API and Features (20min)**: Added user API integration and created a `features` folder for components with business logic. Implemented `UserBalance` feature component to display user balance.

- **Game API Integration and UI Implementation (2h)**: Connected frontend to backend game API:

  - **Game API Integration**: Integrated frontend with api for sessions, rolls, and cashout. Added loading states.
  - **Game UI Components**: Built game interface in `features/game` folder:
    - `Game` component for main slot machine display and controls
    - `GameMachine` component for visual slot machine with spinning animations
    - `SessionBalance` component for session credits and cashout
  - **Game State Management**: Added game context to manage session state and balance across components.
  - **Visual Feedback**: Added spinning animations and win/loss notifications for better user experience.

- **Spinning Animation Implementation (20min)**: Created a simple CSS spinning animation with staggered timing using setTimeout to reveal each symbol at different intervals (1s, 2s, 3s) for a more engaging slot machine experience.

### Step 5: Testing (30min)

- **Docker Setup (15min)**: I decided to set up Docker for easy development and testing from scratch. This allows anyone to run the application without worrying about local environment setup or dependencies. The Docker configuration includes:
  - **Dockerfile**: Implemented Docker builds for both frontend and backend
  - **Docker Compose**: Created a `docker-compose.yml` file that orchestrates both frontend and backend services
- **Dependency Conflict Fix (5 min)**: I discovered a dependency conflict between `@nestjs/swagger` and `@nestjs/common` libraries. I resolved this by downgrading `@nestjs/swagger` to a compatible version.
- **Issues fixed (15min)**:
  - **Game State Management Enhancement**: I found that the game state management was not properly handling the spinning animation state and roll results. I fixed this by adding `pendingRollResult` and `isSpinning` states to the GameContext.
  - **React StrictMode Rendering Issue**: React StrictMode was causing double rendering issues during development, which was interfering with the game's state and animations. I fixed this by removing StrictMode from the main rendering.
  - **Error Handling Improvements**: I found that error messages from API calls were not being properly displayed to users. I implemented an `extractErrorMessage` function for better error handling.
  - **Cashout Button State Management**: I discovered that the cashout button was not being disabled during spinning, which could lead to inconsistent game state. So I disabled the cashout button during spinning.

### Step 6: Final Code Review and Verification (15min)

- **Comprehensive Code Review**: Conducted a thorough review of the entire codebase to ensure all task requirements were properly implemented:
  - Verified server-side cheating mechanism works correctly at 40+ credits (30% re-roll) and 60+ credits (60% re-roll)
  - Confirmed client-side spinning animations with staggered reveal timing (1s, 2s, 3s)
  - Validated session management and credit system functionality
  - Checked cash-out endpoint implementation and session closure
- **Additional Functionality Verification**: Reviewed the extra features that were added to enhance the user experience beyond the basic requirements:
  - **Authentication System**: JWT-based authentication with automatic user creation to meet the task requirements
  - **API Documentation**: Comprehensive Swagger documentation for all endpoints
  - **Game History**: Database storage of all game rolls for tracking and potential future features
  - **Enhanced UI/UX**: Modern styling with Tailwind CSS, proper loading states, and visual feedback
  - **Docker Support**: Containerized setup for easy deployment and testing

### Conclusion

Overall, the task was not particularly challenging from a technical standpoint. However, I decided to implement additional production-like features beyond the basic requirements to create a more polished and realistic application. This included authentication, API documentation, game history tracking, enhanced UI/UX, and Docker containerization. These extra features extended the development time, resulting in approximately 9 hours total including reading and understanding the task, setup, development, testing, and documentation.

Thank you for this fun assignment and good luck with the review!
